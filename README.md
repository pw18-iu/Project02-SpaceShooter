# Project Name
Project 2 for MSCH-C220

A user-controlled ship for a space-shooter game.

Most of the functionality and implementation are similar to those in Exercise 2d, with the following improvements:

First, I replace the ship and enemy sprites using new PNG images/assets from the resource link recommended by the professor.

Second, I add backward movement for the player’s ship by pressing the S key, along with an exhaust sprite effect while moving backward.

Third, I obtain a background image from the same asset source. I use a UI Image as the background for the "Start" and "End" scenes, and a 2D Sprite as the background for the "SampleScene".

Fourth, I add a scoring application for both the player’s ship and the small asteroids.

Fifth, in the "SampleScene", I implement an Esc key, which can go to the End scene, and add a button in the "End" scene that play a new game in the SampleScene.

Finally, I add two enemy ships that move along cosine-shaped paths in different directions.
